install slither into you local machine
install all component in both client and server
run both server

to check the feature
run this first to upload .sol file so that slither can analyze the .sol file
(i already created a sample .sol for checking this feature)

curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/upload-contract -F "contract=@E:/school/COS30049_BlockchainProject/server/uploads/TestContract.sol" -F "name=Test Vulnerable Contract" -F "address=0x123456789abcdef123456789abcdef123456789a"

after that by running http://localhost:xxxx/api/contract/12/  (number 12 is the latest contract id)
you can see the status of the contract after being analyzed by slither

by running http://localhost:xxxx/api/contracts
you can see all the analyzed contracts from database

by running this http://localhost:xxxx/api/contract/12/report 
you can see the result from slither about that contract
